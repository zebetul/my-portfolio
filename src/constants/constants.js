    backgroundStory: `
    When I started learning JavaScript I was very enthusiasthic about it and asked my friends to give me small challenges related to this field. One of my friends asked me if I could find a solution that would allow him to fill in four different forms with the same data and download the results. He had four predefined forms edited in two different formats, PDF and Word documents. He had to fill in those forms for every customer with the same customer data. I thought it was a great idea and I started thinking on it right away. At that  time I allready started learning Javascript and along the way some HTML and CSS, so I knew how to render a basic form in a browser on localhost but I had no idea how to interact with a PDF document or how to deploy a website, so I started researching right away. After a fast forward in the Javascript Udemy course to the Node.js chapter and some documentation read about pdf-lib, the final product was a simple express server which served a public folder containing four PDF documents(with editable fields I had designed) and the index, script and styles files. I installed node on his laptop, of course on his request, and from that moment he is using the app on localhost making his work a lot easier.`,
    techDetails: `The app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used Bootstrap for the UI and pdf-lib library to write the documents. The app is very simple and straightforward, is not responsive and it's only optimized for large screens. I recently deployed it on Render and put the PDF documents on AWS S3, for a better experience.`,
